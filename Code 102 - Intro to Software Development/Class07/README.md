Read: 07 - Programming with JavaScript

Firstly, always keep in mind that the computer read scripts of code from the first line to the last line, which is called the control flow.You can also disrupt the control flow if you are using conditional and loops. Conditional structures or if statements, can require you to complete certain step of a process before moving foward such as filling out all of the necessary data. 
  
  if (isEmpty(field)) {             
  promptUser();
} else {
  submitForm();
}

## The example above is used from: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow 

A PHP or a typical script in JavaScript, includes functions and as I stated earlier conditional, functions and loops. You can look at a function as a operation set up using variable.

>A function from W3 schools as a ex example:

function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}

Functions parameter is located insiade of parentheses ().
Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is operating.

function FredHobbies(ListeningToMusic, Exercising, Eating) {
  // code to be executed
}

ListeningToMusic, Exercising, and Eating  individually are parameter. All together the are called Arguements. 

Function invocation is when a function get involve and execute due to three different reason:

1. When a user clicks a button
2. When it is called from JavaScript code
3. Automatically

A return function is when a function calls on the value that will be carried by an variable.
The example from w3 school

# let x = myFunction(4, 3); 
  // Function is called, return value will end up in x

function myFunction(a, b) {

  return a * b;      
         // Function returns the product of a and b
}

The result in x will be:
