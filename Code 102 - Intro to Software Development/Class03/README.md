Git is a useful tool for developers. It's a free, open source version control system that handles source code changes in the software projects. Version control systems are software that help with keeping track of modifications made to codes. This tool is very useful due to the fact codes has to be very percise, so having a back up can really come in handy.

Git saves a snapshot of the data you change by committing. The software also provides you with a repository or repo in which you can share to anyone, such as your coworkers when you are collabrating. If you want to push or upload your changes use the command line below

# git push [remote-name][branch-name]

If you would like to pull or receive new data from your new upload or your partner you are completing a task with, then use this command line 

# git pull[remote-name][branch-name]
