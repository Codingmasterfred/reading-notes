## React Docs - Forms

### What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
A 'Controlled Component' is a form element whose value is controlled by React state.
### Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
It's better to update the state with the user's response as soon as they enter them as it provides a better user experience.
### How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
To target what the user is entering when using an event handler on an input field, we can access the event object and retrieve the value of the input field.
