## How I explained REST to my brother

### Who is Roy Fielding?
the guy who sends document across the internet
### Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
not set up as a one-submit setup, humans send data for human instead of being for computers
### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
HTTP is an application-layer protocol that governs how data is transmitted over the internet, particularly between web servers and clients such as web browsers.
### What does a GET do?
It is used to retrieve information or resources from a web server.
### What does a POST do?
a POST request is a commonly used request method that is used to submit data to a web server.

### What does PUT do?
the PUT request method is used to update an existing resource on the web server.
### What does PATCH do?
When a PATCH request is sent from a client (such as a web browser) to a server, it includes a set of instructions that specify how the existing resource should be modified.

Please request these keys prior to lecture to allow adequate time because you will need them in order to complete your lab assignment.
