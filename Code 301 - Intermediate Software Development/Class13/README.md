Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?
PUT or PATCH method.

Which REST methods require an ID parameter?

The methods that typically require an ID parameter are GET (to retrieve a specific resource), PUT or PATCH (to update a specific resource), and DELETE (to delete a specific resource).


What's the relationship between REST and CRUD?

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that provides guidelines for designing networked applications, while CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) is a set of basic operations used to manage data in applications. RESTful APIs often implement CRUD operations to provide a standardized way of interacting with resources.


If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

Define the resources and their endpoints.
Choose appropriate HTTP methods for each endpoint.
Implement the necessary logic to handle requests and perform CRUD operations.
Ensure proper handling of HTTP status codes and error conditions.
Document the API to provide usage instructions and specifications to consumers.
