### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
### Structured data with well-defined relationships, such as financial data or user profiles in an e-commerce system.

### Give a real-world example.
### Storing customer orders and related information in a traditional e-commerce database.

### What kind of data is a good fit for a NoSQL database?
### Unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media posts, sensor data, or product catalogs with varying attributes.

### Give a real-world example.
### Storing and analyzing social media data, including user posts, comments, and interactions.

### Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
### NoSQL databases are generally more suitable for hierarchical data storage.

### Which type of database is best for scalability?
### NoSQL databases are typically more scalable due to their distributed nature and flexible data models.

### What does SQL stand for?
### SQL stands for Structured Query Language.

### What is a relational database?
### A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into structured tables with predefined relationships between them.

### What type of structure does a relational database work with?
### Relational databases work with a tabular structure where data is organized into rows and columns within tables.

### What is a 'schema'?
### A 'schema' in the context of a database refers to the structure or blueprint that defines the organization, relationships, and constraints of the data.

### What is a NoSQL database?
### A NoSQL (Not only SQL) database is a type of database that provides a flexible data model for storing and retrieving unstructured or semi-structured data.

### How does it work?
### NoSQL databases use various data models and storage mechanisms to store and retrieve data, such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or wide-column stores.

### What is inside of a MongoDB database?
### Inside a MongoDB database, data is stored in BSON (Binary JSON) format, which is a binary representation of JSON-like documents.

### Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? And why?
### MongoDB is generally considered more flexible than SQL databases because it allows for dynamic schema changes and handles unstructured data more easily.

### What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
### One disadvantage of NoSQL databases is the lack of standardization and the potential for limited support for complex queries and transactional operations.
