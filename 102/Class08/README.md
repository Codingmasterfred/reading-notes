Read: 08 - Operators and Loops

# Comparison operators
A comparison operator is a comparison of two values that could be in a form of a numerical, string or an object. You can campare operand by greater than, less than , equal to, as well as not equal to. It will only read as true or based off if the equation is actually true or false.
There also are different symbol used to formulate an equation. 
> For example
  Equal (==)
  Not equal (!=)
  Strict equal (===) meaning of the same type and equal 3 === 3
  Strict not equal (!==) Could have different data type but are equal or vise versa : 3!=="3"
  Greater than (>)
  Greater than or equal (>=)
  Less than (<)
  Less than or equal (<=)

  # Assignment operators
  Assigning operator can have an outcome of different values. There also are different formula formats for this as well. There are quite a few shorthand property to use. 
                        Operation       Shorthand Operation
    Addition assignment	x += f()        	x = x + f()
    Subtraction assignment	x -= f()    	x = x - f()
    Multiplication assignment	x *= f()	x = x * f()
    Division assignment	x /= f()	        x = x / f()

# Loops

    You can use loops to repeat functions without retyping. There are five different type of loops.
    For, while, do..while, for.. in, and for..of are the different loops. When creating a for loop the variable should be and "i" it is the most common variable and also represent initialization which is the first step of creating a for loop. The next is to meet a conditions for the loop which could be set to the amount of time you would want to repeat the loop. the next step is the after thought, which you can set to the value of each loop that is executed. Finally there is the actual statement which differ based off what you are trying to do. 

    for (initialization; condition; afterthought){
          statement
    }
