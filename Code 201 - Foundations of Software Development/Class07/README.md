### What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
A constructor in JavaScript is a special function that is used to create and initialize objects of a certain type, allowing you to define the properties and methods for the object and enforce constraints or validate inputs during object creation. When called with the new keyword, it creates a new object and sets the this keyword to refer to that object.

In an object literal, the this keyword refers to the object itself, while in a constructor, it refers to the instance of the object being created.
