.Net is an open source platform for developers to build applications, able to run languages such as F# C# and basic visual. There are also different platforms that .NET can access such as .Net Framework,.Net Core, and Xamarin/mono which is combined in the .Net Standard platform

A .NET Hello World App is a simple program written in the .NET framework that displays the message "Hello, World!" as output.

Basic debugging refers to the process of identifying and fixing errors or issues in a program by stepping through the code, inspecting variables, and analyzing program behavior.

Managed code is code that is executed within a managed environment, such as the .NET framework, where the runtime provides services like memory management and automatic garbage collection.

CLR (Common Language Runtime) is the execution environment in the .NET framework that manages and executes managed code, providing services like memory management, security, and exception handling.

As a FedEx material handler, once you've processed a package, you need to send it to its destination. Similarly, in the context of a .NET console application, you need to execute your code to see its output.

### Analogy
Using the .NET CLI command dotnet run, you initiate the execution of your application. This step is similar to dispatching a package for delivery. The application runs, and the console window displays the output, such as "Hello, World!" This output is akin to confirming that the package has reached its destination.
